# Electronic-Components-Defect-Detection
Leveraged various computer vision models to enhance defect detection in electronic components.
Leveraged various computer vision models to enhance defect detection in electronic components, including ViT, RepVGG, Swin Transformer, MobileViT v1/v2, CMT, MiniViT, ShuffleNet, and EfficientNet. A new attention
mechanism was invented to replace the multi-layer convolution in RepVGG, which dramatically reduces the
number of parameters while maintaining the same level of recognition accuracy. 

Applied advanced computer graphics techniques for capacitor bump inspection, which significantly improved
defect detection capabilities and the overall quality assurance process in electronic manufacturing

 
 Quantized models using TensorRT to optimize them for deployment on resource-limited industrial use, achieving
substantial reductions in model size and computational load while maintaining high performance. 


The project has been patented, and has been used in
production.
